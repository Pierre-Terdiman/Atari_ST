The ST BIOS, contrary to the GEMDOS specification, is  call-
able from the 68000's user mode.
      
The BIOS is re-entrant to three levels.  That is, there  may
be  up  to three recursive BIOS calls before the system runs
into trouble.  No level checking  is  performed;  the  first
sign  of an overflow will be mysterious system behavior, and
an eventual crash.
      
Applications should NOT attempt disk or  printer  I/O  (this
includes getbpb calls, and standard-output redirected to the
printer device) in critical-error, system-timer or  process-
terminate handlers.
      
                                  NOTE
      
          The BIOS modifies the function number (and  the  re-
          turn  address)  pushed  on the stack by the applica-
          tion.  The function number on the stack will be ZERO
          on  return.   [For  the  curious: this feature saved
          several cycles per BIOS call ...]
      
       (0) getmpb
           VOID getmpb(p_mpb)
           LONG p_mpb;
                 Upon entry, 'p_mpb'  points  to  a  'sizeof(MPB)'
                 block  to  be  filled  in with the system initial
                 Memory Parameter Block.  Upon return, the MPB  is
                 filled in.

       (2) bconin
           WORD bconin(dev)
           WORD dev;
                 'dev' is the character device number described in
                 function 1.
      
                 Does not return until a character has been  input
                 (busy-wait).   It  returns the character value in
      
      
                        Atari Corp. Confidential
                 D0.L, with the high word zero.
      
                 For the console (CON:, device 2) it  returns  the
                 IBM-PC compatible scancode in the low byte of the
                 upper word, and the Ascii character  in  the  low
                 byte of the low word.
      
                 If bit 3 in the system variable 'conterm' is set,
                 then the high byte of the upper word will contain
                 the value of the system  variable  'kbshift'  for
                 that  keystroke.   [The  default  state for 'con-
                 term%%3' is OFF.]
      
       (3) bconout
           VOID bconout(dev, c)
           WORD dev, c;
                 'dev' is the character device number described in
                 function 1.
      
                 Output character 'c' to  the  device.   Does  not
                 return until the character has been written.
      
       (4) rwabs
           LONG rwabs(rwflag, buf, count, recno, dev)
           WORD rwflag;
           LONG buf;
           WORD count, recno, dev;
                 Read  or  write  logical  sectors  on  a  device.
                 'rwflag' is one of:
      
                         0   read

                         3   write, do not affect media-change
      
      
                 'buf' points to a buffer  to  read  or  write  to
                 (unaligned  transfers -- on odd boundaries -- are
                 permitted, but they are slow).   'count'  is  the
                 number  of  sectors  to transfer.  'recno' is the
                 logical sector number to start the  transfer  at.
                 'dev'  is the device number, and on the ST is one
                 of:
      
                         0   Floppy drive A:
                         1   Floppy drive B: (or "logical" drive A:
                             on single-disk systems).
                         2+  Hard disks, networks, etc.
      
      
                 On return, 0L indicates a  successful  operation.
                 Any negative number indicates an error condition.
                 (It is the responsibility of the BIOS  to  detect

                 code).
      
                 Modes 2 and 3 force  a  physical  disk  operation
                 that  will NOT affect media change, nor result in
                 one (this allows the GEMDOS disk  formatter,  for
                 instance, to read and write logical sectors after
                 formatting a disk, and still allow  the  BIOS  to
                 recognize  a media change on the volume just for-
                 matted).

       (5) setexc
           LONG setexc(vecnum, vec)
           WORD vecnum;
           LONG vec;
                 'vecnum' is the number of the vector  to  get  or
                 set.  'vec' is the address to setup in the vector
                 slot; no set  is  done  if  'vec'  is  -1L.   The
                 vector's previous value is returned.
      
                 Vectors $00 through  $FF  are  reserved  for  the
                 68000.
      
                 Logical vectors $100 through  $1FF  are  reserved
                 for GEMDOS.  Vectors currently implemented are:
      
                       $100  System timer interrupt
                       $101  Critical error handler

                 Logical vectors $200 through $FFFF  are  reserved
                 for  OEM use.  The ST BIOS makes no provision for
                 these.
      
       (6) tickcal
           LONG tickcal()
                 Returns a system-timer calibration value, to  the
                 nearest millisecond.
      
                 This is a silly function,  since  the  number  of
                 elapsed  milliseconds is passed on the stack dur-
                 ing a system-timer trap.
      
       (7) *getbpb
           BPB *getbpb(dev)
           WORD dev;
                 'dev' is a device number (0 for  drive  A,  etc.)
                 Returns a pointer to the BIOS Parameter Block for
                 the specified drive, or 0L if (for  some  reason)
                 the BPB cannot be determined.
      
       (8) bcostat
           LONG bcostat(dev)
                 'dev' is a character device number, as  in  func-
                 tion 1.  Returns character output status:
      
                        -1   Device is ready to send (no waiting on
                             next device-output call).
                         0   Device is not ready to send.
      
      
       (9) mediach
           LONG mediach(dev)
           WORD dev;
                 'dev' is a drive number.  Returns one of:
      
                         0   Media definitely has not changed
                         1   Media /might/ have changed
                         2   Media definitely has changed
      
                 GEMDOS will respond to a return value of '1' with
                 a  read  operation.  If the BIOS detects an abso-
                 lute  media  change,  it  will  return  a  "media
                 change" error at that time.
      
       (10) drvmap
           LONG drvmap()
                 Returns a bit-vector that contains a '1' in a bit
                 position  (0 .. 31) when a drive is available for
                 that bit, or a 0 if there is no  drive  available
                 for the bit.
      
                 Installable disk drivers must correctly  maintain
                 the longword '_drvbits' [see: System Variables].
      
       (11) kbshift
           LONG kbshift(mode)
           WORD mode;
                 If 'mode'  is  non-negative,  sets  the  keyboard
                 shift  bits accordingly and returns the old shift
                 bits.  If 'mode' is less than zero,  returns  the
                 IBM-PC  compatible state of the shift keys on the
                 keyboard, as a bit-vector in the low byte of D0.
      
                 Bit assignments are:
      
                       0     Right shift key
                       1     Left shift key

      These functions are available through trap 14.  The  calling
      conventions  are  the  same as for trap 13.  Contrary to the
      GEMDOS specification, the caller does  NOT  have  to  be  in
      supervisor  mode.   It  is  the  caller's  responsibility to
      cleanup arguments passed to the trap (as per the  C  calling
      standard).
      
      A typical trap handler, one that works  from  a  C  binding,
      might be:
      
          _trap14:
                  move.l  (sp)+,tr14ret   ; pop ret addr
                  trap    #14             ; do BIOS func
                  move.l  tr14ret,-(sp)   ; return to
                  rts                     ;  caller
      
                  bss
          tr14ret: ds.l                   ; saved ret. addr
      
      
      and it might be used like:

           VOID initmous(type, param, vec)
           WORD type;
           LONG param, vec;
                 Initialize mouse packet handler.  'type'  is  one
                 of:
      
                      type   Action
      
                       0     disable mouse

                       4     enable mouse, in keycode mode
      
      
                  'param' points to a parameter block that  should
                 look like:
      
                     struct param {
                         BYTE topmode;
                         BYTE buttons;
                         BYTE xparam;
                         BYTE yparam;
                     };
      
      
                 'topmode' should be:
      
                       0     Y_position == 0 at bottom
                       1     Y_position == 0 at top
      
      
                 'buttons' is a parameter for the keyboard's  "set
                 mouse buttons" command.
      
                 'xparam' and 'yparam' are the X and Y  threshold,

      Extended BIOS         August 26, 1985                     11
      
      
                 For mouse absolute mode,  some  extra  parameters
                 immediately follow the parameter block:
      
                     struct extra {
                         WORD xmax;
                         WORD ymax;
                         WORD xinitial;
                         WORD yinitial;
                     };
      
      
                 'xmax' and 'ymax' specify the  maximum  X  and  Y
                 mouse   positions.    'xinitial'  and  'yinitial'
                 specify the initial X and Y mouse position.
      
                 'vec' points to a mouse  interrupt  handler;  see
                 extended  function  number  34,  'kbdvbase',  for
                 further   information   about   ikbd    subsystem
                 handlers.
      
       (1) ssbrk
           LONG ssbrk(amount)
           WORD amount;
                 Reserve 'amount' bytes from the  top  of  memory.
                 Returns  a long pointing to the base of the allo-
                 cated  memory.   This  function  MUST  be  called
                 before the OS is initialized.
      
                 'ssbrk' is actually pretty useless.  It DOES  NOT
                 work  after GEMDOS has been brought up, since the
                 TPA has already been set up.
      
       (2) _physBase
           LONG _physBase()
                 Get the screen's physical base  address  (at  the
                 beginning of the next vblank).
      
       (3) _logBase
           LONG _logBase()
                 Get the screen's logical base, right away.   This
                 is the location that GSX uses when drawing to the
                 screen.
      
       (4) _getRez
           WORD _getRez()
                 Get the screen's current resolution (returning 0,
                 1 or 2).
      
       (5) _setScreen
           VOID _setScreen(logLoc, physLoc, rez)
           LONG logLoc, physLoc;
           WORD rez;
                 Set the logical  screen  location  (logLoc),  the
                 physical  screen location (physLoc), and the phy-
                 sical screen resolution.  Negative parameters are
                 ignored (making it possible, for instance, to set
                 screen  resolution  without   changing   anything
                 else).
      
                 The logical screen location changes  immediately.
                 The physical screen location hardware register is
                 changed immediately, but the new screen  location
                 will take effect after the next vertical retrace.
      
                 When  resolution  is  changed,  the   screen   is
                 cleared, the cursor is homed, and the VT52 termi-
                 nal emulator state is reset.
      
       (6) _setPallete
           VOID _setPallete(palettePtr)
           LONG palettePtr;
                 Set the contents of the hardware palette register
                 (all  16 color entries) from the 16 words pointed
                 to by 'palettePtr'.  'paletteptr' MUST  be  on  a
                 word  boundary.   The  palette  assignment  takes
                 place at the beginning of the next vertical blank
                 interrupt.
      
       (7) _setColor
           WORD _setColor(colorNum, color)
           WORD colorNum, color;
                 Set the palette number 'colorNum' in the hardware
                 palette table to the given color.  Return the old
                 color in  D0.W.   If  'color'  is  negative,  the
                 hardware register is not changed.
      
       (8) _floprd
           WORD  _floprd(buf,  filler,  devno,  sectno,   trackno,
                 sideno, count)
           LONG buf, filler;
           WORD devno, sectno, trackno, sideno, count;
                 Read one or more  sectors  from  a  floppy  disk.
                 'filler' is an unused longword.  'buf' must point
                 to a word-aligned buffer large enough to  contain
                 the  number of sectors requested.  'devno' is the
                 floppy number (0 or 1).  'sectno' is  the  sector
                 number  to  start reading from (usually 1 through
                 9).  'trackno' is the track number  to  seek  to.
                 'sideno'  is  the side number to select.  'count'
                 is the number of sectors to read (which  must  be
                 less  than  or equal to the number of sectors per
                 track).
      
                 On return, D0 contains a status code.  If  D0  is
                 zero, the operation succeeded.  If D0 is nonzero,
                 the operation failed (and D0  contains  an  error
      
      
                        Atari Corp. Confidential
                 number).
      
       (9) _flopwr
           WORD  _flopwr(buf,  filler,  devno,  sectno,   trackno,
                 sideno, count)
           LONG buf, filler;
           WORD devno, sectno, trackno, sideno, count;
                 Write one or  more  sectors  to  a  floppy  disk.
                 'buf'   must  point  to  a  word-aligned  buffer.
                 'filler' is an unused longword.  'devno'  is  the
                 floppy  number  (0 or 1).  'sectno' is the sector
                 number to start writing to (usually 1 through 9).
                 'trackno'   is  the  track  number  to  seek  to.
                 'sideno' is the side number to  select.   'count'
                 is  the number of sectors to write (which must be
                 less than or equal to the number of  sectors  per
                 track).
      
                 On return, D0 contains a status code.  If  D0  is
                 zero, the operation succeeded.  If D0 is nonzero,
                 the operation failed (and D0  contains  an  error
                 number).
      
                 Writing to the boot sector  (sector  1,  side  0,
                 track 0) will cause the media to enter the "might
                 have changed" state.  This will be  reflected  on
                 the next rwabs() or mediach() BIOS call.
      
       (10) _flopfmt
           WORD _flopfmt(buf, filler, devno, spt, trackno, sideno,
                 interlv, magic, virgin)
           LONG buf, filler;
           WORD devno, spt, trackno, sideno, interlv, virgin;
           LONG magic;
                 Format a track on  a  floppy  disk.   'buf'  must
                 point  to  a  word-aligned buffer large enough to
                 hold an entire track image  (8K  for  9  sectors-
                 per-track).   'filler'  is  an  unused  longword.
                 'devno' is the floppy  drive  number  (0  or  1).
                 'spt'  is the number of sectors-per-track to for-
                 mat (usually 9).  'trackno' is the  track  number
                 to  format  (usually  0  to 79).  'sideno' is the
                 side number to format (0 or 1).  'interlv' is the
                 sector-interleave factor (usually 1).  'magic' is
                 a magic number that MUST be the value  $87654321.
                 'virgin' is a word fill value for new sectors.
      
                 On return, D0 contains a status code.  If  D0  is
                 zero, the operation succeeded.  If D0 is nonzero,
                 the operation failed (and D0  contains  an  error
                 number).   The format function can soft-fail when
                 it finds bad sectors during the verify pass.  The
                 caller  has the choice of attempting to re-format
                 the media, or recording the bad sectors  so  they
                 will not be included in the file system.
      
                 A  null-terminated  (0.W)  list  of  bad   sector
                 numbers  is returned in the buffer.  They are not
                 necessarily in numerical order.  (If  there  were
                 no bad sectors, the first word in the buffer will
                 be zero.)
      
                 A good value for 'virgin'  is  $E5E5.   The  high
                 nibble  of  each  byte  in the 'virgin' parameter
                 must not be equal to $F.  Resist  the  temptation
                 to  format  a  disk  with  sectors initialized to
                 zero.
      
                 Formatting a track will cause the media to  enter
                 the  "definitely  changed"  state.   This will be
                 reflected on the next rwabs() or  mediach()  BIOS
                 call.

       (12) midiws
           VOID midiws(cnt, ptr)
           WORD cnt;
           LONG ptr;
                 Writes a string to the MIDI port.  'cnt'  is  the
                 number  of characters to write, minus one.  'ptr'
                 points to a vector of characters to write.
      
       (13) _mfpint
           VOID _mfpint(interno, vector)
           WORD interno;
           LONG vector;
                 Set the MFP interrupt number 'interno' (0 to  15)
                 to 'vector'.  The old vector is written over (and
                 thus unrecoverable).
      
       (14) iorec
           LONG iorec(devno)
           WORD devno;
                 Returns a pointer  to  a  serial  device's  input
                 buffer record.  'devno' is one of:
      
                     devno   Device
                     -----   --------
                       0     RS232
                       1     Keyboard
                       2     MIDI
                 The structure of the record is:
      
                     struct iorec
                     {
                         LONG ibuf;          /* pointer to buffer */
                         WORD ibufsiz;       /* size of buffer */
                         WORD ibufhd;        /* head index */
                         WORD ibuftl;        /* tail index */
                         WORD ibuflow;       /* low-water mark */
                         WORD ibufhi;        /* high-water mark */
                     };
      
      
                 For RS-232, an output-buffer  record  immediately
                 follows  the  input-buffer record.  The format of
                 the output-buffer record is identical.
      
                 'ibuf' points to the device's buffer.   'ibufsiz'
                 is  the  buffer's size.  'ibufhi' is the buffer's
                 high-water mark.  'ibuflow' is the buffer's  low-
                 water mark.
      
                 If flow control is  enabled  and  the  number  of
                 characters  in  the buffer reaches the high-water
                 mark, the ST requests  (according  to  the  flow-
                 control  protocol)  the  sender  to  stop sending
                 characters.  When the number of characters in the
                 buffer  drops  below  the  low-water mark, the ST
                 tells the sender to resume transmission.
      
                 The flow-control operation  is  similar  for  the
                 RS-232 output record.
      
       (15) rsconf
           VOID rsconf(speed, flowctl, ucr, rsr, tsr, scr)
           WORD speed, flowctl, ucr, rsr, tsr, scr;
                 Configure RS-232 port.  If any  parameter  is  -1
                 ($FFFF),  the  corresponding hardware register is
                 not set.  'speed' sets the port's baud  rate,  as
                 per:
      
                     speed         Rate (bps)

       (16) keytbl
           LONG keytbl(unshift, shift, capslock)
           LONG unshift, shift, capslock;
                 Sets pointers to the keyboard translation  tables
                 for  unshifted  keys,  shifted  keys, and keys in
                 caps-lock mode.  Returns a pointer to the  begin-
                 ning of a structure:
      
                     struct keytab {
                         LONG unshift;       /* -> unshift table */
                         LONG shift;         /* -> shift table */
                         LONG capslock;      /* -> capslock table */

                 Each pointer in the structure should point  to  a

                 taking the byte there.
      
       (17) _random
           LONG _random()
                 Returns a 24-bit psuedo-random  number  in  D0.L.
                 Bits  24..31 will be zero.  The sequence /should/
                 be different each time the system is  turned  on.
                 [The algorithm is from vol. 2 of Knuth:
      
                                  S = [S * C] + K
      
                 where K = 1, C = 3141592621, and S is  the  seed.
                 S  >>  8  is returned.  The initial value of S is
                 taken from the frame-counter '_frclock'.]
                 The function's  behavior  is  surprisingly  good,
                 except  that bit 0 has an /exact/ distribution of
                 50%.  Therefore it is probably not a good idea to
                 test  individual  bits and expect them to be well
                 behaved.
      
       (18) _protobt
           VOID _protobt(buf, serialno, disktype, execflag)
           LONG buf, serialno;
           WORD disktype, execflag;
                 Prototype an image of a boot  sector.   Once  the
                 boot  sector image has been constructed with this
                 function, write it to the volume's boot sector.
      
                 'buf' points to a 512-byte buffer (which may con-
                 tain  garbage,  or  already contain a boot sector
                 image).
      
                 'serialno' is a serial number to stamp  into  the
                 boot  sector.   If  'serialno'  is  -1,  the boot
                 sector's serial number is not changed.  If 'seri-
                 alno'  is  greater  than or equal to $01000000, a
                 random serial number is generated and  placed  in
                 the boot sector.
      
                 'disktype' is either -1 (to leave the  disk  type
                 information alone) or one of the following:
      
                     0: 40 tracks, single sided (180K)
                     1: 40 tracks, double sided (360K)
                     2: 80 tracks, single sided (360K)
                     3: 80 tracks, double sided (720K)
      
      
                 If 'execflag' is 1, the boot sector is made  exe-
                 cutable.   If 'execflag' is 0, the boot sector is
                 made non-executable.  If 'execflag'  is  -1,  the
                 boot  sector remains executable or non-executable
                 depending on the way it was originally.
      
       (19) _flopver
           WORD  _flopver(buf,  filler,  devno,  sectno,  trackno,
                 sideno, count)
           LONG buf, filler;
           WORD devno, sectno, trackno, sideno, count;
                 Verify (by simply reading) one  or  more  sectors
                 from  a floppy disk.  'buf' must point to a word-
                 aligned 1024-byte buffer.  'filler' is an  unused
                 longword.  'devno' is the floppy number (0 or 1).
                 'sectno' is the sector number  to  start  reading
                 from  (usually  1  through  9).  'trackno' is the
                 track number to seek to.  'sideno'  is  the  side
                 number  to  select.   'count'  is  the  number of
                 sectors to verify (which must  be  less  than  or
                 equal to the number of sectors per track).
      
                 On return, D0 contains a status code.  If  D0  is
                 zero, the operation succeeded.  If D0 is nonzero,
                 the operation failed (and D0  contains  an  error
                 number).
      
                 A  null-terminated  (0.W)  list  of  bad   sector
                 numbers  is returned in the buffer.  They are not
                 necessarily in numerical order.  (If  there  were
                 no bad sectors, the first word in the buffer will
                 be zero.)
      
       (20) scrdmp
           VOID scrdmp()
                 Dump screen to printer.  [Currently this  is  the
                 monochrome-only  version from CES.  Will be fixed
                 soon.]
      
       (21) cursconf
           WORD cursconf(function, operand)
           WORD function, operand;
                 Configure  the  "glass  terminal"  cursor.    The
                 'function' code is one of the following:
      
                       0     Hide cursor
                       1     Show cursor
                       2     Cursor set to blink
                       3     Cursor set not to blink
                       4     Set cursor blink timer to 'operand'
                       5     Return cursor blink timer value
      
      
                 The cursor blink rate is based on the video  scan
                 rate  (60hz  for color, 70hz for monochrome, 50hz
                 for PAL).  The 'rate' parameter is equal to  one-
                 half the cycle time.
      
       (22) settime
           VOID settime(datetime)
           LONG datetime;
                 Sets the intelligent keyboard's idea of the  time
                 and date.  'datetime' is a 32-bit DOS-format date
                 and time (time in the low word, date in the  high
                 word).
      
       (23) gettime
           LONG gettime()
                 Interrogates the intelligent keyboard's  idea  of
                 the time and date, and returns that value (in DOS
                 format) as a 32-bit word.  (Time in the low word,
                 date in the high word).
       (24) bioskeys
           VOID bioskeys()
                 Restores the powerup  settings  of  the  keyboard
                 translation tables.
      
       (25) ikbdws
           VOID ikbdws(cnt, ptr)
           WORD cnt;
           LONG ptr;
                 Writes a  string  to  the  intelligent  keyboard.
                 'cnt' is the number of characters to write, minus
                 one.  'ptr' points to a vector of  characters  to
                 write.
      
       (26) jdisint
           VOID jdisint(intno)
           WORD intno;
                 Disable interrupt number 'intno' on the 68901.
      
       (27) jenabint
           VOID jenabint(intno)
           WORD intno;
                 Enable interrupt number 'intno' on the 68901.
      
       (28) giaccess
           BYTE giaccess(data, regno)
           BYTE data;
           WORD regno;
                 Read or write  a  register  on  the  sound  chip.
                 'regno'  is  the  register number, logically ORed
                 with:
      
                     $00 to read [well, ok, you don't
                         /really/ OR with this...]
                     $80 to write
      
                 'data' is a byte to write to the register.
      
                 Sound chip  registers  are  not  shadowed.   Pro-
                 cedures  that change register values by reading a
                 register, modifying a local copy of it, and writ-
                 ing  the  result  back to the register, should be
                 critical sections.  In particular, the BIOS (fre-
                 quently)  updates  the  PORT  A register, and any
                 code  that  read-modify-writes  PORT  A  must  be
                 atomic.
      
       (29) offgibit
           VOID offgibit(bitno)
           WORD bitno;
                 Atomically set a bit in the PORT  A  register  to

       (30) ongibit
           VOID ongibit(bitno)
           WORD bitno;

                 one.
      
       (31) xbtimer
           VOID xbtimer(timer, control, data, vec)
           WORD timer, control, data;
           LONG vec;
                 'timer'  is  the  timer  number  (0,  1,   2,   3
                 corresponding  to  68901  timers  A, B, C and D).
                 'control' is the  timer's  control-register  set-
                 ting.   'data'  is a byte shoved into the timer's
                 data register.  'vec' is a pointer to  an  inter-
                 rupt handler.
      
                 Timers are allocated:
      
                     Timer   Usage
                       A     Reserved for end-users and applications
                       B     Reserved for graphics (hblank sync, etc.)

                       D     RS-232 baud-rate control (this timer's
                             interrupt vector is available to anyone).
      
      
       (32) dosound
           VOID dosound(ptr)
           LONG ptr;
                 Set sound daemon's "program  counter"  to  'ptr'.
                 'ptr'  points  to  a set of commands organized as
                 bytes.
      
                 Command numbers $00 through $0F take a  one  byte
                 argument to be shoved into a sound chip register.
                 (Command $00 shoves the  byte  into  register  0,
                 command  1  shoves  the byte into register 1, and
                 you get the idea...)
      
                 Command $80 takes a one byte  argument  which  is
                 shoved into a temporary register.
      
                 Command $81 takes three one-byte arguments.   The
                 first  argument  is  a  register  number to load,
                 using the temp register.  The second argument  is
                 a  2's  complement  value to be added to the temp
                 register.  The third argument is the  termination
                 value.  The instruction is executed (once on each
                 update) until the temp register equals the termi-
                 nation value.
      
                 Commands  $82  through  $FF   take   a   one-byte
                 argument.   If the argument is zero, the sound is
                 terminated.  Otherwise the argument reflects  the
                 number  of system-timer ticks (at 50hz) until the
                 next update.

           LONG kbdvbase()
                 Returns a pointer to the base of a structure:
      
                     struct kbdvecs {
                         LONG midivec;       /* MIDI-input */

                     };
      
      
                 'midivec' is initialized to point to a  buffering
                 routine in the BIOS.  D0.B will contain a charac-
                 ter read from the MIDI port.
      
                 'vkbderr' and 'vmiderr' are  called  whenever  an
                 overrun  condition is detected on the keyboard or
                 MIDI 6850s.  [Probably not  a  useful  vector  to
                 grab.]
      
                 'statvec', 'mousevec', 'clockvec',  and  'joyvec'
                 point to ikbd status, mouse, real-time clock, and
                 joystick packet handlers.   The  packet  handlers
                 are  passed  a  pointer to the packet received in
                 A0, and on the stack as a LONG.  GEM/GSX uses the
                 mouse  vector.   Handlers  should  return with an
                 RTS, and should not spend more than 1ms  handling
                 the interrupt.
      
                 The 'midisys' and 'ikbdsys'  vectors  are  called
                 when  characters are available on the appropriate
                 6850.  Initially they point to  default  routines
                 (the  MIDI  handler  indirects through 'midivec',
                 and the ikbd handler parses-out ikbd packets  and
                 calls the appropriate subsystem vectors).
      
       (35) kbrate
           WORD kbrate(initial, repeat)
           WORD initial, repeat;
                 Get/set the keyboard's  repeat  rate.   'initial'
                 governs  the  initial  delay  (before  key-repeat
                 starts).  'repeat'  governs  the  rate  at  which
                 key-repeats  are generated.  If a parameter is -1
                 ($FFFF) it is not changed.  Times  are  based  on
                 system ticks (50hz).
      
                 Returns the old key-repeat values, with 'initial'
                 in  the high byte of the low word and 'repeat' in
                 the low byte of the low word.
      
       (36) _prtblk
           VOID _prtblk()
                 Prtblk() primitive [see manual pages on PRTBLK].
      
       (37) vsync
           VOID vsync()
                 Waits until the next vertical-blank interrupt and
                 returns.    Useful   for  synchronizing  graphics
                 operations with vblank.
      
       (38) supexec
           VOID supexec(codeptr)
           LONG codeptr;
                 'codeptr' points to a piece of code, ending in an
                 RTS,  that  is  executed in supervisor mode.  The
                 code cannot perform BIOS or GEMDOS  calls.   This
                 function  is  meant  to  allow  programs  to hack
                 hardware and protected locations  without  having
                 to  fiddle  with  GEMDOS  get/set supervisor mode
                 call.
      
       (39) puntaes
           VOID puntaes()
                 Throws away the AES, freeing  up  any  memory  it
                 used.   If  the AES is still resident, it will be
                 discarded and the system will reboot.  If the AES
                 is not resident (if it was discarded earlier) the
                 function will return.
      
                 There is NO way to throw away the AES and  return
                 --  the  reboot MUST be performed.  [Ok, ok -- we
                 know this is a lose.]

                        CONOUT Escape Sequences
      
      These are the escape  functions  interpreted  by  the  BIOS'
      conout()  function.   For the most part they emulate a VT-52
      terminal [that's the easy one to do].  There are  extensions
      to  hack screen colors, control screen wrap, and a few other
      simple functions.
      
      ESC A
      Cursor Up
           This sequence moves the cursor up  one  line.   If  the
           cursor  is  already on the top line of the screen, this
           sequence has no effect.
      
      ESC B
      Cursor Down
           This moves the cursor down one line.  If the cursor  is
           already  on  the  last  line of the screen, this escape
           sequence has no effect.
      
      ESC C
      Cursor Forward
           This moves the cursor one position to  the  right.   If
           this  function  would  move  the cursor off the screen,
           this sequence has no effect.
      
      ESC D
      Cursor Backward
           This move the cursor one position to the left.  This is
           a  non-  destructive  move  because  the character over
           which the cursor now rests is not replaced by a  blank.
           If  the  cursor  is  already  in  column O, this escape
           sequence has no effect.
      
      ESC E
      Clear Screen (and Home Cursor)
           This moves the cursor to  column  O,  row  I  (the  top
           left-hand corner of the screen), and clears all charac-
           ters from the screen.
      
      ESC H
      Home Cursor
           This move the cursor to column O, row O.  The screen is
           NOT cleared.
      
      ESC I
      Reverse Index
           Moves the cursor to the same horizontal position on the

           preceding  lines.   If the cursor is on the top line, a
           scroll down is performed.
      
      ESC J
      Erase to End of Page
           Erases all the information from cursor (including  cur-
           sor position) to the end of the page.
      
      ESC K
      Clear to End of Line
           This sequence clears the line from the  current  cursor
           position to the end of the line.
      
      ESC L
      Insert Line
           Inserts a new blank line by moving the line that cursor
           is  on,  end all following lines, down one line.  Then,
           the cursor is moved to the beginning of the  new  blank
           line.
      
      ESC M
      Delete Line
           Deletes the contents of the line that the cursor is on,
           places  the  cursor at the beginning of the line, moves
           all the following lines up one line, and adds  a  blank
           line at the bottom.
      
      ESC Y
      Position Cursor
           The two characters that follow the "Y" specify the  row
           and  column  to  which  the cursor is to be moved.  The
           first character specifies the row, the second specifies
           the colum.  Rows and columns number from 1 up.
      
      ESC b
      Set Foreground Color
           The Foreground Color is the color in which the  charac-
           ter is displayed.
      
           Escape-b must be followed by a color selection  charac-
           ter.  Only the four least significant bits of the color
           character are used:

      ESC c
      Set Background Color
           This function selects Background Color,  the  color  of
           the cell that contains the characters.
      
           Escape-c must be followed by a color selection  charac-
           ter.  Only the four least significant bits of the color
           character are used.  (See diagram for ESC-b function)
      
      ESC d
      Erase Beginning of Display
           This sequence erases from beginning of the  display  to
           the  cursor  position.   The  cursor position is erased
           also.
      
      ESC e
      Enable Cursor
           This sequence causes the cursor to be  invisible.   The
           cursor  may  still be moved about on the display, using
           escape sequence defined in this appendix.
      
      ESC f
      Disable Cursor
           This sequence causes the cursor to be  invisible.   The
           cursor  may  still be moved about on the display, using
           escape sequences defined in this appendix.
      
      ESC j
      Save Cursor Position
           This sequence preserves the  current  cursor  position.
           You  can  restore  the  cursor  to the previously saved
           position with ESC-k.
      
      ESC k
      Restore Cursor Position
           This sequence restores the cursor to a previously saved
           position.  If you use this sequence without having pre-
           viously saved the cursor position, then the  cursor  is
           moved to the home position, the top left-hand corner of
           the screen.
      
      ESC l
      Erase Entire Line
           This sequence erases an entire line and moves the  cur-
           sor to the leftmost column.
      
      ESC o
      Erase Beginning of Line
           Erases from the beginning of the line to the cursor and
           includes the cursor position.
      
      ESC p
      Enter Reverse Video Mode
           Enters the reverse video mode so  that  characters  are
           displayed  as  background  color  characters on a fore-
           ground colored cell.
      
      ESC q
      Exit Reverse Video Mode
           Exits the reverse video mode.
      
      ESC v
      Wrap at End of Line
           This sequence causes the first character past the  last
           displayable  position  on  a  line  to be automatically
           placed in the first  character  position  on  the  next
           line.  The page scrolls up if necessary.
      
      ESC w
      Discard at End of Line
           Following invocation of this sequence, after  the  last
           displayable  character  on a line has been reached, the
           characters overprint.  Therefore, only the last charac-
           ter received is displayed in the last column position.

      The divide-by-zero vector is pointed at an RTE.
      
      All other traps (Bus Error, et al) are pointed at a  handler
      that dumps the processor state and attempts to terminate the
      current process.  [See: System Initialization]
      
      The Line 1010 ("Line Aye") vector is used as a short-circuit
      around  the  VDI  to  the ST's graphics primitives.  It is a
      powerful and useful interface; see the `Line A' document for
      further information.
      
      The Line 1111 ("Line Eff")  trap  is  currently  being  used
      internally  to  the  system.  If you fiddle with this vector
      the AES will break.
      
      The FDC/HDC interrupt may be enabled by a hard  disk  device
      driver.   The floppy disk code, however, assumes this inter-
      rupt is disabled (it busy-waits on the input  bit's  state).
      It  is  the responsibility of other drivers in the system to
      ensure that, when the  floppy  disk  read/write/format  code
      gets control, the FDC/HDC interrupt is disabled.
      
      The processor's normal interrupt priority level is 3.   This
      is  to  prevent  HBLANK (autovector level 2) interrupts from
      occurring on every scanline.  [It would eat about 10%  of  a
      system  running  in a color graphics mode, or about 22% of a
      system running in monochrome.   Yuck.]  The  default  HBLANK
      interrupt handler modifies the interrupted process' IPL to 3
      and performs an RTE.  This is to  discourage  programs  from
      using IPL 0 -- to use HBLANK, use an IPL of 1.
      
      To prevent "jittering" in programs that change screen colors
      on  the  fly,  using the HBLANK and HSYNC interrupt vectors,
      the following hack will keep the  system  intact  and  still
      yield a solid display:
      
         [1] Re-vector the keyboard/MIDI interrupt  to  a  routine
             that  lowers  the IPL to 5 and then jumps through the
             original vector.
      
         [2] During the "critical"  section  of  the  screen,  re-
             vector  the  200hz  system  clock interrupt vector to
             point to a routine  that  increments  a  counter  and
             RTEs.   The counter keeps track of the number of sys-
             tem ticks that occur during the critical section.
      
         [3] After the critical section, block interrupts (at  IPL
             6)  and call the sytem clock handler (JMP through the
             interrupt vector, with a fake SR and  return  address
             on  the  stack)  the number of times indicated by the
             counter.
                             System Variables
      
      
         This is a list of variables in the ST BIOS that have been
         "cast  in  concrete".   Their  locations  and meanings in
         future revisions of the ST BIOS  are  guarenteed  not  to
         change.
      
         Any other variables in RAM, routines in the ROM, or  vec-
         tors  below  $400 that are not documented here are almost
         certain to change.  It is  important  not  to  depend  on
         undocumented variables or ROM locations.
      
         etv_timer (long) $400
             Timer handoff vector (logical vector $100).  See GEM-

         etv_xtra (longs) $40c
             Space for logical vectors $103 through $107).
      
         memvalid (long) $420
             Contains the magic number $752019F3, which  (together
             with  'memval2') validates 'memcntlr' and indicates a
             successful coldstart.
      
         memcntlr (byte) $424
             Contains memory controller configuration nibble  (the
             low  nibble).   For  the full story, see the hardware
             manual.  Some popular values are:
      
                 Memory size     Value
                 128K            0

                 1MB (2 banks)   5
      
      
         resvalid (long) $426
             If 'resvalid' is the magic number $31415926 on system
             RESET, the system will jump though 'resvector'.
      
      
      
      
         resvector (long) $42a
             System-RESET bailout vector, valid if 'resvalid' is a
             magic  number.  Called early-on in system initializa-
             tion (before /any/ hardware registers, including  the
             memory  controller  configuration register, have been
             touched).  A return address will be loaded  into  A6.
             Both stack pointers will contain garbage.
      
         phystop (long) $42e
             Physical top of RAM.  Contains a pointer to the first
             unusable byte (i.e. $80000 on a 512K machine).
      
         _membot (long) $432

             tion uses this value as the start of the GEMDOS TPA.
      
         _memtop (long) $436
             Top of available memory.  The 'getmpb' BIOS  function
             uses this value as the end of the GEMDOS TPA.
      
         memval2 (long) $43a
             Contains the magic number $237698AA  which  (together
             with 'memvalid') validates 'memcntlr' and indicates a
             successful coldstart.
      
         flock (word) $43e
             Used to lock  usage  of  the  DMA  chip.   Should  be
             nonzero  to ensure that the OS does not touch the DMA
             chip registers during vertical blank.   Device-driver
             writers  TAKE  NOTE: this variable MUST be nonzero in
             order to make use of the DMA bus.
      
         seekrate (word) $440
             Default floppy seek rate.  Bits zero and one  contain
             the default floppy disk seek rate for both drives:
      
                 00      6ms
                 01      12ms
                 10      2ms
                 11      3ms [default]
      
      
         _timr_ms (word) $442
             System timer calibration (in ms).  Should be $14  (20
             decimal), since the timer handoff vector is called at
             50hz.  Returned  by  BIOS  function  '_tickcal',  and
             passed on the stack to the timer handoff vector.
      
         _fverify (word) $444
             Floppy verify flag.   When  nonzero,  all  writes  to
             floppies  are  read-verified.   When  zero, no write-
             verifies  take  place.   The  default  state   (after
             system-reset) is to verify.
      
         _bootdev (word) $446
             Contains the device  number  the  system  was  booted
             from.   The BIOS constructs an enviroment string from
             this variable before bringing up the desktop.
      
         palmode (word) $448
             When nonzero, indicates the system is  in  PAL  (50hz
             video)  mode.   When zero, indicates the system is in
             NTSC (60hz video) mode.
      
         defshiftmd (byte) $44a
             Default video resolution.  If the system is forced to
             change  from  monochrome  mode to a color resolution,
             'defshiftmd' contains the resolution the system  will
             switch to.
      
         sshiftmd (word) $44c
             Contains shadow for 'shiftmd' hardware register:
      
                 0       320x200x4 (low resolution)
                 1       640x200x2 (medium rez)
                 2       640x400x1 (high rez / "monochrome")
      
      
         _v_bas_ad (long) $44e
             Pointer to base of screen memory.  Always on  a  512-
             byte  boundary.   Always  points to 32K of contiguous
             memory.
      
         vblsem (word) $452
             Semaphore to enforce mutual  exclusion  in  vertical-
             blank  interrupt  handler.   Should  be '1' to enable
             vblank processing,
      
         nvbls (word) $454
             Number of longwords that '_vblqueue' points to.   (On
             RESET, defaults to 8).
      
         _vblqueue (long) $456
             Pointer to a vector of pointers to vblank handlers.
      
         colorptr (long) $45a
             Pointer to a vector of 16  words  to  load  into  the
             hardware  palette  registers  on the next vblank.  If
             NULL, the palettes are  not  loaded.   'colorptr'  is
             zeroed after the palettes are loaded.
      
         screenpt (long) $45e
             Pointer to the base of screen memory, to be setup  on
             the  next  vblank.   If  NULL, the screen base is not
             changed.
      
         _vbclock (long) $462
             Count of vertical-blank interrupts.
      
         _frclock (long) $466
             Count of vertical-blank  interrupts  that  were  pro-
             cessed (not blocked by 'vblsem').
      
         hdv_init (long) $46a
             Vector to hard disk initialization.  NULL if unused.
      
         swv_vec (long) $46e
             The system follows this  vector  when  it  detects  a
             transition  on  the "monochrome monitor detect" input
             (from low to high  rez,  or  visa-versa).   'swv_vec'
             initially  points to the system reset handler; there-
             fore the system will reset if the user changes  moni-
             tors.
      
         hdv_bpb (long) $472
             Vector to routine to return a hard disk's Bios Param-
             eter  Block  (BPB).   Same calling conventions as the

         hdv_rw (long) $476
             Vector to routine to read or write on  a  hard  disk.
             Same  calling  conventions  as  the BIOS function for
             RWABS.  NULL if unused.
      
         hdv_boot (long) $47a
             Vector to routine to boot from hard  disk.   NULL  if
             unused.
      
         hdv_mediach (long) $47e
             Vector to routine  to  return  a  hard  disk's  media
             change  mode.   Same  as  BIOS  binding for floppies.
             NULL if unused.
      
         _cmdload (word) $482
             When nonzero an attempt is made to load  and  execute
             COMMAND.PRG  from  the boot device.  (Load a shell or
             an application in place of the desktop).  Can be  set
             to nonzero by a boot sector.
      
         conterm (byte) $484
             Contains attribute bits for the console system:
      
                 Bit     Function
                 0       nonzero: enable bell when ^G is written to CON:
                 1       nonzero: enable key-repeat
                 2       nonzero: enable key-click
                 3       nonzero: on BIOS conin() function, return the
                                  current value of 'kbshift' in bits
                                  24..31 of D0.L.
                         zero:    leave bits 24..31 alone...
      
         themd (long) $48e
             Filled in by the BIOS on a 'getmpb'  call;  indicates
             to GEMDOS the limits of the TPA.  The structure is:
      
      
                 struct MD
                 {
                         MD      *m_link;        /* ->next MD [NULL] */
                         long    m_start;        /* start of TPA */
                         long    m_length;       /* size of TPA (bytes) */
                         PD      *m_own;         /* ->MD's owner [NULL] */
                 } ;
      
      
             The structure may NOT be changed once GEMDOS has been
             initialized.   In  addition, there may be only ONE of
             these suckers (you can't use the  'm_link'  field  in
             the  first MD).  Someday these (with a better GEMDOS)
             these limitations may be lifted.
      
         savptr (long) $4a2
             Pointer to register save area for BIOS functions.
      
         _nflops (word) $4a6
             Number of floppy disks actually attached to the  sys-
             tem (0, 1, or 2).
      
         sav_context (long) $4ae
             Pointer to saved  processor  context  (more  on  this
             later).
      
         _bufl (long) $4b4
             Two (GEMDOS) buffer-list  headers.   The  first  list
             buffers data sectors, the second list buffers FAT and
             directory sectors.  Each of these pointers points  to
             a BCB (Buffer Control Block), that looks like:
      
      
                 struct BCB
                 {
                         BCB     *b_link;        /* next BCB */
                         int     b_bufdrv;       /* drive#, or -1 */
                         int     b_buftyp;       /* buffer typet BCB
